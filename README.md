DPThoughtDex is an automated social bookmarking application for Django. Links from arbitrary sources are collected, indexed, and displayed in date or related formats.

Links can be added to the roll in the following ways:

- importing IRC logs generated by irssi
- an xmlrpc call using a username and API key
- reading from a Rackspace Cloud Queue (maybe?)
- custom providers

It defines several data types:

Link
- source*
- author*
- url
- guid
- message
- original
- pub_date
- tags

Other possible entries could be... 
- type
- excerpt

Source
- name
- url
- icon

Author
- name
- user*
- url
- avatar
- api_key

Tag
- name

So you could have a few different views of the data:

list of all running links from all sources under /links/.
/links/author/
/links/source/
/links/tags/tagname



Getting Data in

there are a couple of possibilities for entering data.  You can create a message queue that pushes dictionaries in.

You can also 

Basics

Define how to get data into the app. Can use a RabbitMQ or Cloud Queues thingamabob, I guess. Otherwise, poll an irssi log? These could be separated out like so:

providers/__init__.py
providers/queues.py
providers/irssi.py
providers/myprovider.py

The reason for separating these out, there are imports for each provider that wouldn't necessarily be relevant for others...
